    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** Your answer here - \n",
    "In this lab, we created and tested different machine learning models to help predict the price  of tickets for ski resorts, specifically for our target of Big Mountain. We first created a model that simply takes the mean ticket price, excluding Big Mountain, to establish a baseline to compare other models too. It also allowed us to see how well the mean on its own was at predicting ticket prices. After this, we split the data into a test set and a training set with 30% going to the test set and the remaining 70 to the training. The data was also cleaned so that only numeric data was used. The training set was used to create the models and the test set was for feeding data into the model to test its performance. As expected, using the mean meant that R2 was equal to zero since it did not explain any of the variation in the data. Using the mean also showed a mean absolute error of about 18- 19 dollars depending on if we used test or train data, meaning that our model should expect to be off by 18-19 dollars when making future predictions. The same was done for mean square error which was shown to be off by an even higher amount. After this, we filled in or “imputed” the missing values of columns by taking the mean of each one. This was to see if the missing values are skewing the data or not. After being  updated, the data was scaled so that each column would be on the same scale, therefore readable by a machine learning model. This new model was used and showed great improvements in  the R2 score, the median absolute value, and the median squared error, showing we were on the right track.  The model predicted the training data much better than the test data, showing that we may be overfitting the model. Because of this, we used the SelectKBest function to use the features that are most representative of the variance in the data. This initially showed worse predictions. We decided to then use cross validation so that our model could be tested on smaller subsets of the data that it hasn't seen. This helps with the problem of having the model be really good on the train data but not being able to predict other data well. After this, we calculated what the most relevant features in the data were and found that vertical drop and fast quads were numbers 1 and 2. Finally, we decided to try a random forest model which showed runs being the best feature. This model ended up being the best model for out data and we decided to use it. \n"
